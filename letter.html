                <p><strong>Dear Future Guardians of the Earth,</strong></p>
                <p>In a decade and a half, I envision a world where harsh climates are no longer a threat. I see
                    thriving green jungles, pristine beaches, and communities powered solely by wind, sunlight, and
                    plant-based energy. By then, I hope that the responsibilities we once neglected will have been
                    embraced—leading to cleaner environments, better health, and renewed protection for wildlife.</p>
                <p>I dream of a time when majestic species, especially those under threat like elephants, are no longer
                    hunted but safeguarded with pride. Their survival depends on the choices we make today—shifting away
                    from destruction and moving toward sustainability with compassion and purpose.</p>
                <p>To nature—we thank you deeply for your beauty, your gifts, and your resilience. It is our solemn
                    promise to protect and preserve you, not just for ourselves but for the grandchildren we may never
                    meet.</p>
                <p>With hope and responsibility,<br><strong>Regine P. Sumagaysay</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Dear Mother Nature,</strong></p>
                <p>I just want to express my deepest thanks to the Forest Guardians who dedicate their time and energy
                    to protecting your forests. Their love and commitment to nature are truly inspiring. Because of
                    their hard work, your ecosystems stay in balance, and the animals and plants that call the forest
                    home are kept safe. What they do reminds all of us how important it is to care for our planet.</p>
                <p>I hope you continue to bless and guide them in everything they do. May their passion inspire more
                    people to stand up for nature and be part of the change.</p>
